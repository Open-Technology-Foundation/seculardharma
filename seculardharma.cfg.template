long_desc = "The Secular Dharma Knowledge System is a sophisticated AI-powered research platform that bridges ancient wisdom traditions with contemporary scientific understanding to explore ethical living through secular interpretations of dharma. Built on advanced vector search technology (FAISS) with access to 777,553+ interdisciplinary documents, the system serves the rapidly growing demographic of 'spiritual but not religious' individuals, academics, and professionals seeking evidence-based approaches to wisdom traditions without supernatural beliefs.\n\nThe platform addresses the explosive growth in secular spirituality and mindfulness practice, serving academics generating scholarly content, content creators developing educational materials, mental health professionals integrating secular mindfulness approaches, and the broader secular Buddhism movement. Through modular research generation and video essay creation tools, users can produce comprehensive philosophical content across configurable depth levels and multiple output formats - from quick overviews to comprehensive academic articles and educational video scripts in documentary, educational, or narrative styles.\n\nGrounded in evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, and cross-cultural anthropology, the system treats secular and religious approaches to dharma with equal validity while maintaining rigorous academic standards. It explores dharma as universal human ethical patterns that emerge across cultures through evolutionary processes, providing critical analysis of power dynamics and cultural appropriation while supporting contemporary applications in AI ethics, climate philosophy, and planetary consciousness. With support for multiple state-of-the-art language models and robust error handling, the system represents a mature platform for sophisticated philosophical content generation that honors both ancient wisdom and modern scientific methodology."
