**[On Screen: Title Card – “Defining Dharma: A Journey to the West”]**

**[Cut to black screen with text:]**

> “Dharma” is an often fuzzy, ill-defined word and concept—especially in the Western world, where it is a relative newcomer.

**[Cut to speaker, seated in a quiet study or natural setting]**

My name is Gary Dean. For the purpose of this exploration, I describe myself as an anthropologist. But more than that, I am a student of human meaning-making—of how we, as a species, construct frameworks to live by, to live with, and to live through.

This film is about one such framework: *dharma*.

But what is *dharma*?

What is *a* dharma?

What is *the* dharma?

And what exactly do we mean when we use this word?

These are not merely linguistic questions. They are existential ones. They ask how we orient ourselves in a world of impermanence, complexity, and interdependence. They ask how we live ethically, how we belong, and how we sustain coherence—within ourselves, within our communities, and within the wider web of life.

**[B-roll: slow-motion footage of people in various cultural settings—monks walking in silence, a doctor in a hospital, a craftsman at work, a protester holding a sign, a child planting a tree]**

For many years, I have explored these questions through the lenses of human evolutionary biology, evolutionary psychology, anthropology, and sociology. These disciplines offer more than academic insight—they reveal the deep patterns of human behavior, cognition, and culture that shape the ways we live and the ways we suffer.

They also reveal the adaptive structures we have developed to hold life together. *Dharma* is one such structure.

**[On screen: montage of ancient texts, carvings, manuscripts, and philosophical portraits]**

My research has been deeply informed by many thinkers—giants across time and tradition—who have shaped the way we understand ethics, order, and meaning.

**[On screen, display the list, fading in one name at a time:]**

- Gautama Buddha  
- Socrates  
- Marcus Aurelius  
- Niccolò Machiavelli  
- Baruch Spinoza  
- Arthur Schopenhauer  
- Charles Darwin  
- Edward Osborne Wilson  
- David Sloan Wilson  
- Stephen Batchelor  
- Robert Sapolsky  
- David Graeber  
- Rupert Bozeat  
- Elfie Klinger

**[Cut to speaker]**

Each of these figures, in their own way, has contributed to a broader understanding of what it means to live well, to live wisely, and to live together. Some spoke of virtue. Some of power. Some of evolution. Some of liberation. But all were concerned, in one way or another, with the same question: *How should we live?*

This is the question at the heart of *dharma*.

**[B-roll: aerial shots of cities, forests, temples, and marketplaces—places where dharmas are lived and embodied]**

In this film, we will explore *dharma* not as a fixed doctrine, but as a living inquiry. We will trace its roots in ancient traditions, follow its evolution through time, and examine its many expressions across cultures—from religious paths to secular ethics, from martial codes to contemplative practices.

We will ask how dharmas emerge, how they function, and why they endure.

We will examine how dharmas shape identity, aesthetics, and belonging.

And we will reflect on what it means for a dharma to arrive in the West—not as an exotic import, but as a response to the same human needs that gave rise to it thousands of years ago.

**“Defining ‘Dharma’”**





## Defining 'Dharma'

**[On Screen: Section Title – “Defining ‘Dharma’”]**

**[Cut to speaker in a study, seated beside ancient Sanskrit manuscripts or a globe]**

The word *dharma* originates from the ancient Sanskrit root *dhṛ*—meaning “to hold,” “to support,” or “to sustain.” This root is not merely linguistic; it is ontological. It points to the function of dharma as that which holds life together—socially, ethically, cosmologically.

**[B-roll: Close-up of Sanskrit manuscripts, stone inscriptions, and ancient Indian temples]**

In the earliest Vedic texts, *dharma* was inseparable from *ṛta*—the cosmic order. It referred to the principles that sustain the universe, the rituals that uphold society, and the duties that bind individuals to their roles. It was not a single law, but the very structure of lawful existence.

As Indian philosophical traditions evolved, so too did the meanings of dharma. In Hinduism, it became the moral and social duties appropriate to one’s caste, stage of life, and personal nature. In Buddhism, *dharma* came to signify the teachings of the Buddha—the path to liberation from suffering. In Jainism, it was the principle of non-violence and the discipline of ascetic purity. In Sikhism, it became a call to righteous action and service in the world.

**[On Screen: Text fades in with each tradition:]**

- Hinduism: duty, order, and cosmic alignment  
- Buddhism: teaching, truth, and liberation  
- Jainism: non-violence and spiritual discipline  
- Sikhism: service and righteous living

**[B-roll: Footage of diverse religious rituals—Hindu puja, Buddhist meditation, Jain monks walking barefoot, Sikh langar kitchens]**

Despite these differences, the etymological root remains consistent: *dharma* is that which sustains. It is the invisible architecture of coherence—within the self, within society, within the cosmos.

**[Cut to speaker]**

But *dharma* is not merely a religious term. Its root meaning—“to hold”—extends into secular and scientific domains. In systems theory, we speak of homeostasis: the dynamic balance that sustains life. In evolutionary biology, we observe pro-social behaviors—like fairness, empathy, and cooperation—that hold groups together. These, too, are dharmic functions.

**[B-roll: Footage of ant colonies, human cities, neurons firing, and families sharing meals]**

To understand *dharma* etymologically is to glimpse its function: not as a commandment, but as a pattern. A pattern that holds. A pattern that supports. A pattern that sustains.

**[On Screen: Text appears]**

> Dharma is not a rule.  
> It is a rhythm.  
> A structure of support—evolving, adaptive, alive.

**[Cut to speaker]**

This is the foundation upon which all dharmas rest. Whether spoken in Sanskrit, Pali, Greek, Latin, or Zulu—whether expressed in temples, in classrooms, or in code—dharma is that which holds us in place, even as the world shifts beneath our feet.

**“Beyond Etymology: Dharma as an Idea”**





## Beyond Etymology: _Dharma_ as an Idea

**[On Screen: Section Title – “Beyond Etymology: Dharma as an Idea”]**

**[Cut to speaker in a quiet room, surrounded by books, maps, and cultural artifacts]**

The word *dharma* may have its roots in Sanskrit, but the idea it represents is not confined to the Indian subcontinent. Across human history, cultures have developed frameworks—explicit or implicit—for sustaining ethical life, social coherence, and existential orientation. These frameworks may not always be called “dharma,” but they serve the same function: to hold life together.

**[B-roll: Footage of diverse cultural rituals—African drumming circles, Confucian ceremonies, Indigenous councils, Stoic statues, Buddhist monasteries]**

To speak of *dharma* as an idea is to recognize it as a universal human response to the challenges of living in a complex, impermanent, and interdependent world. It is not a doctrine, but a pattern. Not a belief system, but a mode of orientation. It is the architecture of meaning that emerges wherever human beings seek to live well—together.

In Southern Africa, the philosophy of *Ubuntu* expresses this dharmic impulse: “I am because we are.” It is a relational ethic that affirms the interconnectedness of all persons and the necessity of mutual care.

In ancient Greece, Stoicism articulated a dharma of rational self-mastery, virtue, and alignment with nature’s order. The Stoic sage, like the Buddhist arhat, cultivates equanimity in the face of suffering and impermanence.

In Confucian China, *li* and *ren*—ritual propriety and humaneness—formed the backbone of a dharma rooted in relational ethics, social harmony, and moral cultivation.

Among the Māori of Aotearoa, *tikanga* provides a living dharma grounded in ancestry, land, and right relationship. It is not a written code, but a dynamic system of values, rituals, and responsibilities that sustain both community and cosmos.

**[On Screen: Text fades in, one line at a time]**

- Ubuntu (Africa): “I am because we are”  
- Stoicism (Greece): Virtue through reason and restraint  
- Confucianism (China): Harmony through relationship and ritual  
- Tikanga Māori (Aotearoa): Right action through ancestral alignment

**[Cut to speaker]**

These are not isolated curiosities. They are convergent responses to the same evolutionary pressures: the need to cooperate, to regulate behavior, to navigate suffering, and to construct meaning in the face of death.

From the perspective of evolutionary psychology, dharmic systems encode pro-social behaviors—fairness, empathy, reciprocity—that enhance group survival. From the perspective of systems theory, they function as stabilizing feedback loops within complex social ecologies.

**[B-roll: Footage of bees in a hive, people working in a community garden, a courtroom in session, a classroom in discussion]**

To live without a dharma is to drift without orientation. To live with a dharma is to inhabit a path—a way of being that aligns thought, feeling, and action with a deeper order, whether that order is conceived as divine, natural, ancestral, or emergent.

Dharma, as an idea, is not about conformity. It is about coherence.

It is not about obedience. It is about orientation.

It is not about dogma. It is about discernment.

**[On Screen: Text appears]**

> Dharma is not a belief.  
> It is a way of holding life—ethically, relationally, responsively.

**[Cut to speaker]**

When we recognize dharma as a universal human idea, we begin to see its many names, its many forms, and its many functions. We see that every culture, in its own way, has asked the same question: *How shall we live?*

And in response, each has crafted its own dharma—its own path of coherence, care, and continuity.

**[B-roll: Montage of cultural symbols—Buddhist wheel, African kente cloth, Confucian calligraphy, Māori carvings, Stoic texts]**

To understand dharma as an idea is to understand humanity itself—not as a species of isolated individuals, but as a species of meaning-makers, pattern-seekers, and ethical architects.

**[Fade to black. Soft music begins.]**

**[On Screen: Next section title fades in]**

**“The Concept of a Dharma”**





## The _Concept_ of a Dharma

**[On Screen: Section Title – “The Concept of a Dharma”]**

**[Cut to speaker in a study, with diagrams of neural networks, cultural maps, and evolutionary trees behind them]**

A dharma is not a commandment. It is not a creed. It is not a single truth handed down from above. A dharma is a framework—a structure of orientation that helps human beings live ethically, coherently, and adaptively within the conditions of their world.

To speak of the *concept* of a dharma is to recognize it as a cognitive and cultural technology—an evolved response to the perennial challenges of human life: how to act, how to belong, how to endure, and how to flourish.

**[B-roll: Footage of early human settlements, cave paintings, tribal gatherings, and ancient rituals]**

From an evolutionary perspective, Homo sapiens is a deeply social species. Our survival has always depended on cooperation, coordination, and shared meaning. But cooperation is fragile. It requires regulation. It requires trust. It requires shared frameworks that help individuals align their behavior with the needs of the group.

Dharmas emerge as those frameworks.

They encode norms, values, and practices that sustain group cohesion, regulate behavior, and provide existential orientation. They are not arbitrary. They are shaped by the ecological, social, and technological conditions in which they arise.

**[On Screen: Text appears]**

> A dharma is a path of coherence—between self and society, action and consequence, life and impermanence.

**[Cut to speaker]**

Cognitively, dharmas function as schemas—mental models that help us interpret the world, predict outcomes, and choose actions. They reduce complexity by providing ethical heuristics: rules of thumb for how to behave, how to relate, and how to respond.

Emotionally, they provide grounding. They help integrate inner states—desire, fear, anger, compassion—into socially intelligible forms. They offer scripts for grief, for celebration, for conflict, for reconciliation.

Socially, they are scaffolds of trust. They allow strangers to cooperate, communities to endure, and generations to transmit wisdom.

**[B-roll: Footage of a courtroom, a classroom, a religious ceremony, a protest march, a family dinner]**

A dharma is not fixed. It is dynamic. It evolves. It adapts. It is responsive to feedback—cultural, ecological, psychological. When the world changes, dharmas must change with it—or risk collapse.

This is why dharmas differ across cultures and epochs. The dharma of a nomadic tribe is not the dharma of an industrial city. The dharma of a warrior caste is not the dharma of a contemplative monk. The dharma of a physician is not the dharma of a farmer. Each arises from a different configuration of needs, risks, and relationships.

And yet, across this diversity, certain patterns recur.

**[On Screen: Text fades in, line by line]**

- Ethical orientation  
- Social cohesion  
- Existential meaning  
- Psychological integration  
- Cultural transmission

These are the functions that dharmas perform—whether they are expressed in religious codes, professional ethics, indigenous customs, or secular philosophies.

**[Cut to speaker]**

To understand the concept of a dharma is to understand that ethical life is not reducible to laws or doctrines. It is a living process—a negotiation between biology and culture, between individual agency and collective necessity.

Dharmas are the bridges between instinct and insight, between impulse and integrity.

They are the architectures of meaning that allow human beings not only to survive, but to live with dignity, with purpose, and with care.

**[B-roll: Footage of a teacher mentoring a student, a healer tending to a patient, a craftsman shaping wood, a monk walking in silence]**

Wherever human beings ask, “What should I do?”—a dharma begins to form.

Wherever they ask, “How do I live well with others?”—a dharma takes shape.

Wherever they ask, “What does it mean to be human in this world?”—a dharma becomes necessary.

**[On Screen: Text appears]**

> A dharma is not a belief.  
> It is a way of being—held, tested, and lived.

**[Cut to speaker]**

In the next section, we will meet the ancient philosophers who gave voice to these dharmas—who shaped the ethical architectures of their time, and whose insights continue to echo in our own.

**[Fade to black. Soft music begins.]**

**“The Ancient Dharmic Philosophers”**





## The Ancient Dharmic Philosophers

**[On Screen: Section Title – “The Ancient Dharmic Philosophers”]**

**[Cut to speaker standing in front of a large, ancient map of Eurasia, with key philosophical centers marked: Athens, Magadha, Lu, and the Yangtze River Valley]**

Between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, a remarkable convergence occurred across the ancient world. In regions as distant as Greece, India, and China, thinkers emerged who would forever alter the ethical and philosophical landscapes of their civilizations. Though separated by geography and language, these figures shared a common concern: how to live well in a world marked by impermanence, suffering, and social upheaval.

They were not merely philosophers in the modern academic sense. They were architects of dharmas—framers of ethical paths, social visions, and existential orientations. Their teachings were not abstract theories. They were living frameworks, designed to guide individuals and societies toward coherence, clarity, and care.

**[B-roll: Ancient ruins of Athens, Bodh Gaya, Chinese temples, and Jain caves in India]**

Let us begin with the Indian subcontinent.

**[On Screen: Text – “Mahāvīra (c. 599–527 BCE)”]**

Mahāvīra, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, articulated a dharma rooted in radical non-violence—*ahiṃsā*. For Mahāvīra, every living being possessed a soul, and to harm another was to harm oneself. His path demanded ascetic discipline, ethical restraint, and deep compassion. The Jain dharma is one of purification—of body, speech, and mind—through the minimization of harm and the cultivation of detachment.

**[B-roll: Jain monks walking barefoot, sweeping the ground before them, meditating in silence]**

**[On Screen: Text – “Gautama Buddha (c. 563–483 BCE)”]**

Contemporary to Mahāvīra, Siddhartha Gautama—the Buddha—offered a dharma of liberation through insight. Rejecting both sensual indulgence and extreme asceticism, he taught the Middle Way: an Eightfold Path of ethical conduct, mental discipline, and wisdom. The Buddha’s dharma is not a belief system, but a method—a way of seeing clearly into the nature of suffering, impermanence, and non-self. It is a dharma of mindfulness, compassion, and non-reactivity.

**[B-roll: Footage of Theravāda monks in meditation, laypeople offering alms, and the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya]**

**[Cut to speaker]**

While the Indian dharmic traditions emphasized liberation from the cycle of suffering, in China, a different set of concerns shaped the ethical imagination.

**[On Screen: Text – “Confucius (Kong Fuzi, c. 551–479 BCE)”]**

Confucius, born in the state of Lu during a time of political fragmentation, envisioned a dharma of relational harmony. He taught that ethical life begins in the family and radiates outward through ritual, respect, and responsibility. His core virtues—*ren* (benevolence), *li* (ritual propriety), and *xiao* (filial piety)—formed the backbone of a dharma that sought to restore moral order through self-cultivation and social coherence.

**[B-roll: Chinese scholars practicing calligraphy, families honoring ancestors, teachers instructing students in Confucian texts]**

**[On Screen: Text – “Laozi (c. 6th century BCE?)”]**

In contrast, Laozi—the legendary founder of Daoism—offered a dharma of alignment with the Dao, the ineffable Way that underlies all things. His teaching emphasized *wu wei*—non-coercive action, or effortless responsiveness. Laozi’s dharma is one of simplicity, humility, and attunement to natural rhythms. It is not about controlling the world, but about flowing with it—like water, soft yet powerful.

**[B-roll: Flowing rivers, bamboo forests, Daoist hermits in mountain retreats, ink paintings of nature]**

**[Cut to speaker]**

Meanwhile, in the Mediterranean world, another dharmic voice emerged.

**[On Screen: Text – “Socrates (c. 470–399 BCE)”]**

Socrates, the Athenian gadfly, posed a radical question: *What is the good life?* His dharma was one of inquiry—relentless, dialogical, and ethical. He claimed to know nothing, yet insisted that the unexamined life was not worth living. Socrates taught that virtue is knowledge, and that the soul must be cared for through philosophical reflection and moral clarity. His path was not one of withdrawal, but of civic engagement—of living justly in the polis, even at the cost of death.

**[B-roll: Reenactments of Socratic dialogues, the ruins of the Athenian Agora, the trial of Socrates]**

**[Cut to speaker]**

These ancient philosophers—Mahāvīra, the Buddha, Confucius, Laozi, and Socrates—did not offer identical answers. But they responded to a shared condition: the breakdown of old orders, the rise of new complexities, and the existential disorientation of their age.

Their dharmas were not escapist. They were adaptive. They offered ways to live with integrity in a world of uncertainty. They cultivated virtues—compassion, restraint, wisdom, humility—not as ideals, but as practices.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

- Mahāvīra: Non-violence and ascetic clarity  
- Buddha: Mindfulness and liberation through insight  
- Confucius: Harmony through ethical relationship  
- Laozi: Simplicity and alignment with the Way  
- Socrates: Inquiry and the care of the soul

**[B-roll: Montage of diverse practitioners—Jain monks, Buddhist meditators, Confucian scholars, Daoist hermits, modern philosophers]**

**[Cut to speaker]**

These dharmic architects laid the foundations for ethical life across civilizations. Their teachings endure not because they offer certainty, but because they offer orientation. They remind us that to be human is to ask: *How shall I live?* And to live well is to walk a path—a dharma—that holds us in the face of impermanence.

**[Fade to black. Soft ambient music begins.]**

**“The Axial Age and the Emergence of Dharmas”**





## The Axial Age and the Emergence of Dharmas

**[On Screen: Section Title – “The Axial Age and the Emergence of Dharmas”]**

**[Cut to speaker standing before a large timeline stretching from 1000 BCE to 0 CE, with markers for India, China, Greece, and the Near East]**

Between 800 and 200 BCE, a profound transformation rippled across the ancient world. In India, China, Greece, and the Near East, civilizations undergoing rapid urbanization, political upheaval, and cultural expansion gave rise to a new kind of thought—a new kind of ethical architecture.

This was the Axial Age.

A term coined by the German philosopher Karl Jaspers, the Axial Age refers not to a single event, but to a convergence: a turning point in human consciousness. It was during this epoch that the foundational dharmas of many enduring traditions emerged—not as inherited myths, but as reflective responses to the new complexities of scale, diversity, and impermanence.

**[B-roll: Aerial footage of ancient cities—Pataliputra, Luoyang, Athens, Babylon—bustling with trade, crowds, and construction]**

As populations grew and cities expanded, the old tribal codes and kinship-based norms could no longer sustain coherence. The village gave way to the polis, the clan to the kingdom, the oral tradition to the written law. With these changes came new anxieties: the fragility of order, the alienation of the individual, the unpredictability of fate.

Walls were built—not only of stone, but of law, ritual, and ideology. Boundaries were drawn—between citizen and foreigner, ruler and ruled, sacred and profane. In response, thinkers across cultures began to ask deeper questions:

**[On Screen: Text fades in, line by line]**

- What does it mean to live justly in a world of power and violence?  
- How should one act when the gods are silent, and the state is corrupt?  
- What is the self, and how does it relate to the cosmos?  
- How can we live well in a world that is always changing?

**[Cut to speaker]**

These were not merely philosophical inquiries. They were existential imperatives. And the answers that emerged were not universal doctrines, but dharmas—adaptive frameworks for ethical life, suited to the conditions of their time.

**[B-roll: Footage of Buddhist monks meditating, Confucian scholars debating, Greek philosophers in dialogue, Zoroastrian fire temples]**

In India, the Upanishadic sages turned inward, seeking the eternal in the self (*ātman*) and its unity with the absolute (*brahman*). The Buddha, witnessing the suffering of all beings, articulated a dharma of mindfulness, compassion, and liberation from craving.

In China, Confucius responded to social disintegration with a dharma of relational harmony, ritual propriety, and moral cultivation. Laozi, in contrast, offered a dharma of effortless alignment with the Dao—the ungraspable flow of nature.

In Greece, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle explored virtue, justice, and the examined life, laying the groundwork for Western moral philosophy. Their dharmas were rooted not in divine command, but in reason, dialogue, and the cultivation of character.

**[On Screen: Text appears]**

> The Axial Age was not the birth of religion.  
> It was the birth of reflection.

**[Cut to speaker]**

These dharmas were not imposed from above. They emerged from below—from the lived experiences of individuals navigating new forms of complexity. They were not static codes, but dynamic responses—cultural technologies for sustaining coherence in a world of flux.

They addressed the ethical challenges of scale: How do we live with strangers? How do we govern without tyranny? How do we care for others beyond our kin?

They addressed the existential challenges of impermanence: How do we face death? How do we endure suffering? How do we find meaning in a world that offers no guarantees?

**[B-roll: Footage of ancient texts being copied, temples being built, students learning from teachers, people gathering in marketplaces]**

The dharmas of the Axial Age were not identical, but they shared common features. They emphasized inner transformation over external ritual. They valued ethical discernment over blind obedience. They cultivated virtues—compassion, restraint, wisdom, humility—not as ends in themselves, but as means of sustaining life together.

They were not merely moral systems. They were existential grammars—ways of speaking, thinking, and acting that allowed human beings to live with dignity amidst uncertainty.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

> The dharmas of the Axial Age were not answers.  
> They were orientations.  
> They were maps for navigating the unknown.

**[Cut to speaker]**

As empires rose and fell, as religions institutionalized and codified these teachings, the original dharmic impulse continued to evolve. It adapted to new technologies, new ecologies, new crises. But its core function remained: to hold life together—ethically, socially, and existentially.

The Axial Age reminds us that dharmas are not relics of the past. They are responses to the perennial conditions of human life. And as our world grows ever more complex, ever more interconnected, the need for new dharmas—rooted in ancient insight, yet responsive to modern realities—becomes ever more urgent.

**[B-roll: Footage of modern cities, climate protests, digital networks, interfaith gatherings, scientific labs]**

**“Common Characteristics of a Dharma”**





## Common Characteristics of a Dharma

**[On Screen: Section Title – “Common Characteristics of a Dharma”]**

**[Cut to speaker in a study, with a chalkboard diagram showing overlapping circles labeled: Ethics, Culture, Biology, and Meaning]**

Across time and culture, dharmas have emerged in many forms—religious, secular, indigenous, philosophical. They have been called by many names: *dharma*, *li*, *ubuntu*, *tikanga*, *virtus*, *bushidō*. Yet beneath this diversity lies a set of shared structural features—common characteristics that define what a dharma is, and what it does.

These characteristics are not accidental. They reflect deep patterns in human cognition, biology, and social organization. They are the evolutionary architecture of ethical life.

**[On Screen: Text fades in, one line at a time]**

- Adaptability  
- Ethical Orientation  
- Social Cohesion  
- Psychological Integration  
- Existential Meaning  
- Aesthetic Expression

**[Cut to speaker]**

**Adaptability.**  
Dharmas are not rigid codes. They are living systems—responsive to feedback, sensitive to context, and capable of transformation. A dharma that cannot adapt will collapse. A dharma that evolves can endure.

Whether in the shift from oral to written law, from agrarian to digital society, or from tribal to global identity, dharmas must reconfigure themselves to remain relevant. This adaptability is not a weakness. It is the mark of a dharma’s vitality.

**[B-roll: Footage of ancient scrolls, modern protest signs, digital ethics conferences, and interfaith gatherings]**

**Ethical Orientation.**  
At their core, dharmas provide a compass. They orient individuals toward what is considered right, just, or appropriate within a given context. This orientation is not merely moralistic—it is functional. It enables cooperation, reduces conflict, and fosters trust.

Whether through the Five Precepts of Buddhism, the Ten Commandments of Abrahamic faiths, the Hippocratic Oath of medicine, or the unspoken codes of indigenous reciprocity, dharmas teach us how to live with others.

**[On Screen: Text appears]**

> A dharma is not a rulebook.  
> It is a grammar of action.

**Social Cohesion.**  
Dharmas are social technologies. They bind individuals into communities through shared values, rituals, and roles. They create the conditions for belonging, for mutual recognition, for interdependence.

In small-scale societies, this may take the form of kinship obligations and oral law. In large-scale civilizations, it becomes institutionalized through legal codes, educational systems, and cultural norms. In both cases, the function is the same: to hold the group together.

**[B-roll: Footage of communal meals, legal courts, religious ceremonies, and neighborhood clean-ups]**

**Psychological Integration.**  
Dharmas help individuals align their inner lives with outer expectations. They provide scripts for managing emotion, desire, grief, and aspiration. They offer rituals for transition, symbols for identity, and narratives for coherence.

Without such integration, the self fragments. With it, the self becomes situated—within a story, a lineage, a purpose.

**[On Screen: Text appears]**

> A dharma is not imposed.  
> It is inhabited.

**Existential Meaning.**  
Every dharma addresses, in some form, the fundamental questions of human life: What is the self? What is death? What is suffering? What is the good?

Dharmas do not eliminate uncertainty. They provide a way to live within it. They offer practices—not answers—that help us navigate impermanence with dignity and clarity.

Whether through meditation, prayer, service, or silence, dharmas cultivate resilience in the face of the unknown.

**[B-roll: Footage of a funeral procession, a solitary figure meditating, a child asking questions, a sunset over a mountain range]**

**Aesthetic Expression.**  
Dharmas are not only cognitive or ethical structures. They are embodied in form—through clothing, architecture, music, gesture, and ritual. These aesthetic expressions are not decorative. They are ethical media. They signal belonging, reinforce discipline, and transmit values.

The robe of a monk, the uniform of a soldier, the regalia of a chief, the simplicity of a Quaker meeting house—all are aesthetic manifestations of dharmic commitments.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

> A dharma is seen before it is spoken.  
> It is worn before it is understood.

**[Cut to speaker]**

These common characteristics—adaptability, ethical orientation, social cohesion, psychological integration, existential meaning, and aesthetic expression—are not checkboxes. They are interwoven functions. Together, they form the anatomy of a dharma.

Wherever human beings seek to live together with integrity, wherever they ask how to act, how to belong, and how to endure, a dharma takes shape.

**[B-roll: Montage of diverse human scenes—pilgrims walking, scientists in dialogue, elders teaching children, artists painting murals, activists embracing]**

**“Why Do Dharmas Exist?”**





## Why Do Dharmas Exist?

**[On Screen: Section Title – “Why Do Dharmas Exist?”]**

**[Cut to speaker in a dimly lit study, with a globe turning slowly in the background. A chalkboard behind them reads: “Survival. Coherence. Meaning.”]**

Dharmas exist because human life is fragile, complex, and interdependent. We are not solitary creatures. We are born into webs of relationship—familial, ecological, political, and existential. To survive, we must cooperate. To cooperate, we must orient ourselves—ethically, emotionally, and socially. Dharmas are the frameworks that make this orientation possible.

They are not arbitrary inventions. They are adaptive responses—emergent patterns that help human beings navigate the conditions of life. They arise wherever people must live together, make decisions, resolve conflict, and endure suffering.

**[B-roll: Footage of early human settlements, tribal councils, families gathered around fires, and elders telling stories to children]**

From an evolutionary perspective, dharmas function as cultural technologies. They encode behaviors that enhance group cohesion, reduce internal conflict, and increase the likelihood of survival. Traits such as fairness, empathy, reciprocity, and restraint—central to many dharmic systems—are not moral luxuries. They are evolved strategies for living well together.

In small-scale societies, these behaviors are regulated through kinship, custom, and oral tradition. In larger, more complex societies, they are formalized through law, religion, and philosophy. In both cases, the function remains the same: to hold life together.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

> Dharmas exist to sustain coherence—  
> within the self,  
> within the group,  
> within the world.

**[Cut to speaker]**

Psychologically, dharmas provide integration. They help individuals align their inner states—desire, fear, anger, compassion—with external expectations. They offer scripts for grief, for celebration, for conflict, for forgiveness. Without such integration, the self fragments. With it, the self becomes situated—within a story, a lineage, a purpose.

Socially, dharmas provide trust. They allow strangers to cooperate, institutions to function, and communities to endure. They regulate behavior not through coercion alone, but through shared meaning. A dharma is a contract—not of law, but of orientation.

Existentially, dharmas provide meaning. They do not eliminate suffering, but they frame it. They do not explain death, but they situate it. They do not guarantee justice, but they call us to pursue it. In the face of impermanence, dharmas offer continuity—not of form, but of function.

**[B-roll: Footage of funerals, weddings, coming-of-age rituals, and communal feasts across different cultures]**

Dharmas also serve as repositories of memory. They carry the ethical experiments of past generations—what worked, what failed, what endured. They are vessels of ancestral wisdom, encoded in ritual, story, and symbol. In this sense, dharmas are not only adaptive—they are archival. They preserve the hard-won insights of those who came before.

**[On Screen: Text appears]**

> A dharma is not just a path forward.  
> It is a thread backward—into history, into ancestry, into the deep time of human becoming.

**[Cut to speaker]**

In times of stability, dharmas provide continuity. In times of crisis, they offer resilience. They help individuals and groups respond to disruption without disintegration. They are not immune to failure—but they are designed to adapt.

When old dharmas no longer serve, new ones emerge. This is not a betrayal of tradition. It is the fulfillment of its function: to support life, in whatever form life now takes.

**[B-roll: Footage of climate protests, digital ethics panels, interfaith dialogues, and youth-led community initiatives]**

In the modern world, where traditional anchors have frayed and new technologies reshape our relationships, the question is not whether we need dharmas—but what kinds of dharmas we now require.

Dharmas exist because human beings cannot live without orientation. We are not machines. We are meaning-makers. We need frameworks that tell us not only how to survive, but how to live—how to care, how to choose, how to belong.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

> Dharmas exist because life is not self-explanatory.  
> Because freedom without form is fragmentation.  
> Because ethics without orientation is paralysis.  
> Because we are human—and to be human is to ask:  
> *What is the right way to live?*

**[Cut to speaker]**

Dharmas are not answers. They are responses. They are not fixed. They are evolving. They are not imposed. They are inhabited.

They exist because we exist—not as isolated minds, but as interdependent beings, seeking coherence in a world that is always changing.

**“The Evolution of Dharmas”**





## The Evolution of Dharmas

**[On Screen: Section Title – “The Evolution of Dharmas”]**

**[Cut to speaker in front of a large wall map showing shifting borders over time—empires rising and falling, trade routes expanding, cities emerging]**

Dharmas are not static codes etched into stone. They are living frameworks—emergent, adaptive, and responsive to the changing conditions of human life. Like languages, ecosystems, and cultures, dharmas evolve.

They evolve because the conditions of life evolve.

As environments shift—ecologically, technologically, politically—so too must the ethical architectures that support human flourishing. A dharma that once sustained coherence in a tribal village may falter in a global metropolis. A dharma forged in the rhythms of agriculture may fracture under the pressures of automation and digital abstraction.

**[B-roll: Time-lapse footage of cities growing, forests shrinking, people using smartphones, satellites orbiting Earth]**

The evolution of dharmas is not linear. It is not a march from superstition to reason, or from tradition to progress. It is a branching, recursive, and often contested process—shaped by feedback, crisis, and innovation.

Some dharmas ossify. They become rigid, brittle, unable to adapt. Others mutate—absorbing new insights, integrating new knowledge, reconfiguring their forms while preserving their functions.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

> Dharmas evolve not to preserve the past,  
> but to sustain coherence in the present.

**[Cut to speaker]**

Historically, dharmas have evolved in response to several key pressures:

**1. Scale and Complexity.**  
As human societies grew from kin-based bands to cities, states, and empires, dharmas had to scale. What once relied on face-to-face trust now required law, bureaucracy, and institutional ethics. The dharma of a village elder gave way to the dharma of a magistrate, a priest, a constitution.

**[B-roll: Footage of ancient city walls, courtroom proceedings, and modern parliaments]**

**2. Technological Disruption.**  
The invention of writing, the printing press, the internet—each transformed how dharmas were transmitted, debated, and embodied. Oral dharmas became textual. Textual dharmas became digital. Authority shifted—from elders to scribes, from priests to scientists, from tradition to algorithm.

**[B-roll: Scrolls being copied by hand, Gutenberg press printing pages, people scrolling on smartphones]**

**3. Cross-Cultural Contact.**  
Trade, conquest, migration, and globalization have brought dharmas into contact—and often into conflict. In these encounters, dharmas hybridize. They borrow, resist, reinterpret. The Buddhist dharma that entered China became infused with Daoist metaphysics. The Stoic dharma of Greece found echoes in Christian monasticism. The dharma of yoga, once a path of renunciation, is now practiced in urban studios across the globe.

**[B-roll: Footage of interfaith dialogues, fusion rituals, and yoga classes in Western cities]**

**4. Ecological and Existential Crisis.**  
In times of collapse—whether due to war, famine, or climate change—dharmas are tested. Some fracture. Others deepen. New ones emerge. The rise of environmental ethics, digital minimalism, and global human rights frameworks are not accidents. They are dharmic responses to planetary thresholds.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

> When the world changes,  
> the question is not whether dharmas will evolve—  
> but which ones will survive.

**[Cut to speaker]**

The evolution of dharmas is not only reactive. It is also creative. New dharmas are born—not from ideology alone, but from lived necessity.

- The dharma of the physician evolves with biotechnology and pandemics.
- The dharma of the teacher evolves with AI and remote learning.
- The dharma of the citizen evolves with surveillance, migration, and digital governance.

Each profession, each community, each generation must ask anew: What is the right way to live now?

**[B-roll: Footage of doctors in PPE, teachers on video calls, climate activists marching, engineers coding ethical AI]**

In this way, dharmas are not relics of the past. They are experiments in the present. They are not commandments from above. They are responses from within.

They evolve through dialogue, through dissent, through failure and reform. They evolve through art, through science, through suffering and solidarity.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

> A dharma is not a fossil.  
> It is a flame—  
> passed from hand to hand,  
> reshaped by each who carries it.

**[Cut to speaker]**

To understand the evolution of dharmas is to understand that ethics is not fixed. It is situated. It is historical. It is ecological. It is embodied.

And as the conditions of life continue to shift—through climate change, artificial intelligence, demographic upheaval, and spiritual dislocation—the dharmas of the future will not be those that cling to purity, but those that adapt with integrity.

**[B-roll: Children planting trees, elders teaching stories, programmers writing ethical code, intergenerational conversations]**

**“Examples of Dharmas in Human Cultures”**





## Examples of Dharmas in Human Cultures

**[On Screen: Section Title – “Examples of Dharmas in Human Cultures”]**

**[Cut to speaker in a room filled with cultural artifacts—religious texts, medical instruments, martial regalia, and political banners]**

Dharmas are not confined to temples or scriptures. They are not limited to monks or mystics. They are embedded in the fabric of human life—in the ways we worship, govern, heal, and defend. Across cultures and centuries, dharmas have emerged to guide behavior, sustain coherence, and orient meaning within specific domains of life.

They are not all-encompassing worldviews. Many are domain-specific: religious, political, professional, or martial. Each arises from a distinct set of conditions, yet each performs the same essential function—to hold life together.

Let us examine four such domains.

---

### 1. Religious Dharmas  
**[On Screen: Text – “Religious Dharmas”]**

Religious dharmas are among the oldest and most enduring. They offer cosmological orientation, moral guidance, and ritual coherence. They answer not only the question of how to live, but why to live—and for whom.

In Hinduism, dharma is the sacred duty aligned with cosmic order (*ṛta*), caste, and stage of life. In Jainism, it is the path of non-violence and spiritual purification. In Sikhism, it is righteous action and selfless service.

But among the most influential and widely practiced is the Buddhist dharma.

**[On Screen: Text – “The Dharma of Theravāda Buddhism”]**

The Buddhist dharma is not a commandment, but a path—a way of seeing, acting, and being that leads to the cessation of suffering. Rooted in the Four Noble Truths, it recognizes that life is marked by *dukkha*—unsatisfactoriness—and that liberation arises through ethical conduct, mental discipline, and insight.

The Eightfold Path—right view, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration—is not a dogma, but a framework for ethical and existential transformation.

**[B-roll: Footage of monks in meditation, laypeople offering alms, and quiet forest monasteries]**

The Buddhist dharma is not merely individual. It is relational. It cultivates compassion, non-reactivity, and interdependence. It is a dharma of clarity in the face of impermanence—a way of holding life lightly, yet with care.

---

### 2. Political Dharmas  
**[On Screen: Text – “Political Dharmas”]**

Political dharmas arise wherever power must be exercised, legitimacy maintained, and justice pursued. They are the ethical scaffolds of governance—whether in the form of divine kingship, democratic constitutions, or revolutionary manifestos.

Confucianism, for example, is both a personal and political dharma, emphasizing the moral cultivation of rulers and the ritual coherence of society. The Islamic concept of *sharīʿa* functions as a legal and moral dharma, integrating law, ethics, and governance.

But one of the most profound political dharmas to emerge in recent history is Ubuntu.

**[On Screen: Text – “Ubuntu (Southern Africa)”]**

Ubuntu, often translated as “I am because we are,” is a relational dharma rooted in African philosophy. It affirms that personhood is not an individual possession, but a communal achievement. It is not the self that precedes society, but society that shapes the self.

Ubuntu guided the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in post-apartheid South Africa. It informed a politics of healing, not revenge; of restoration, not retribution.

**[B-roll: Footage of South African community gatherings, reconciliation meetings, and murals with Ubuntu slogans]**

Ubuntu is not a utopia. It is a dharma—a framework for ethical governance in a fractured world. It reminds us that justice without empathy is brittle, and that political life must be rooted in mutual recognition.

---

### 3. Occupational and Professional Dharmas  
**[On Screen: Text – “Professional Dharmas”]**

Every profession carries its own dharma—its own code of conduct, its own ethical commitments. In medieval Europe, guilds regulated the dharma of the artisan. In Confucian China, the scholar-official embodied a dharma of service and integrity. In modern times, journalism, engineering, and education each carry implicit or explicit dharmas.

But few are as ancient, and as ethically charged, as the dharma of the physician.

**[On Screen: Text – “The Physician’s Dharma”]**

The physician’s dharma is not merely to cure, but to care. It is a dharma of presence—of witnessing suffering without turning away. It is grounded in compassion, integrity, and the principle of *non-maleficence*—do no harm.

In contemporary contexts, this dharma extends beyond the clinic. It includes public health, ecological awareness, and technological ethics. The physician must now navigate AI diagnostics, genetic editing, and systemic inequality—all while preserving the dignity of the patient.

**[B-roll: Footage of doctors in hospitals, rural clinics, and pandemic response teams]**

The physician’s dharma is not a job description. It is a vow—to hold fragile life with informed compassion, and to steward systems that make such holding possible.

---

### 4. Military and Martial Dharmas  
**[On Screen: Text – “Martial Dharmas”]**

Wherever violence is sanctioned, dharmas emerge to regulate it. Martial dharmas are not about glorifying war. They are about restraining it—channeling aggression, cultivating discipline, and embedding honor within the machinery of force.

In medieval Europe, the code of chivalry blended Christian piety with knightly virtue. In Islamic tradition, *adab al-harb* outlined the ethics of war. In indigenous societies, warrior dharmas often included rituals of purification, reconciliation, and spiritual accountability.

But perhaps the most refined expression of martial dharma is found in Bushidō.

**[On Screen: Text – “Bushidō (Japan)”]**

Bushidō, the “Way of the Warrior,” is the ethical code of the samurai. It emphasizes loyalty, courage, honor, and self-discipline. It is not merely about combat, but about character. The true warrior, in Bushidō, is not one who conquers others, but one who conquers the self.

**[B-roll: Footage of kendo practice, samurai armor, and calligraphy of Bushidō virtues]**

Bushidō is a dharma of restraint in the face of power. It teaches that the sword must be guided by wisdom, and that death is not to be feared if one lives with integrity.

In modern Japan, Bushidō continues to influence business ethics, martial arts, and cultural identity. It is a dharma that has evolved—but not vanished.

---

**[Cut to speaker]**

These examples—religious, political, professional, and martial—are not exhaustive. They are illustrative. They show that dharmas are not abstract ideals. They are lived paths—shaped by context, sustained by practice, and tested by time.

They show that wherever human beings must act with care, wield power, serve others, or face death, a dharma arises.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

&gt; A dharma is not a belief.  
&gt; It is a way of being—held in the body, enacted in the world.

**“The Samin of Java”**





## The Samin of Java

**[On Screen: Section Title – “The Samin of Java”]**

**[Cut to speaker seated in front of a map of Java, with archival photos of colonial-era Indonesia and rural Javanese villages]**

In the late 19th century, amid the tightening grip of Dutch colonial rule in the Indonesian archipelago, a quiet yet profound dharma emerged in the heart of Java. It did not arise in temples or courts, nor was it codified in sacred texts. It emerged in rice fields, village gatherings, and whispered refusals.

This was the dharma of the Samin.

**[B-roll: Archival footage and photographs of Javanese peasants, colonial officials, and rural landscapes]**

Founded by Samin Surosentiko around 1890, the Samin movement—also known as Sedulur Sikep—was not a religion in the formal sense, nor a political revolution in the conventional sense. It was a dharma: a way of life rooted in ethical clarity, nonviolence, and resistance to coercive authority.

The Samin dharma arose as a response to colonial exploitation—particularly the seizure of communal forests, the imposition of taxes, and the bureaucratic machinery that alienated villagers from their land and labor. But its response was not violent. It was ethical refusal.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

> The Samin did not fight with weapons.  
> They resisted with silence, simplicity, and steadfastness.

**[Cut to speaker]**

At the heart of the Samin dharma is the principle of *honest living*—a commitment to truthfulness, non-harm, and self-sufficiency. Samin teachings were transmitted orally, through parables, proverbs, and example. There were no scriptures, no temples, no priests. The dharma lived in practice.

**[B-roll: Footage of Javanese farmers tending rice fields, elders speaking to children, and simple village homes]**

The Samin refused to pay colonial taxes—not out of rebellion, but out of principle. They believed that the earth was not a commodity to be owned or taxed, but a shared mother to be cared for. They rejected the authority of colonial courts, the legitimacy of imposed laws, and the morality of systems built on exploitation.

Their dharma emphasized:

- **Simplicity**: Living without excess, without greed, without deceit.
- **Nonviolence**: Refusing to harm others, even in the face of injustice.
- **Communal Reciprocity**: Sharing resources, labor, and responsibility.
- **Respect for the Earth**: Seeing the land not as property, but as kin.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

> “The forest is not the government’s.  
> The forest is the people's.  
> The forest is life.”  
> —Samin proverb

**[Cut to speaker]**

The Samin dharma is not a utopia. It is a practice of ethical coherence in a world of systemic violence. It is a refusal to participate in structures that violate the principles of honesty, care, and mutual respect.

In this way, the Samin dharma echoes other dharmic traditions:

- Like the Buddhist path, it emphasizes non-reactivity and ethical speech.
- Like Daoism, it values simplicity and alignment with natural rhythms.
- Like Gandhian satyagraha, it resists injustice through moral clarity and nonviolence.

But the Samin dharma is also distinct. It is deeply local, rooted in Javanese cosmology, language, and land. It does not seek universalization. It seeks integrity.

**[B-roll: Footage of Samin communities today—young people learning from elders, communal farming, traditional ceremonies]**

Despite decades of marginalization, surveillance, and modernization, the Samin dharma endures. It has adapted—some Samin now engage with formal education, participate in broader society, and use technology. But the core remains: a commitment to honesty, simplicity, and care.

In an age of ecological collapse, consumer excess, and bureaucratic alienation, the Samin dharma offers a quiet but powerful alternative. It reminds us that resistance need not be loud, that wisdom need not be written, and that coherence can be cultivated in the soil beneath our feet.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

> The Samin did not write books.  
> They planted rice, told stories, and lived their dharma.

**[Cut to speaker]**

The dharma of the Samin is not a relic of the past. It is a living testament to the human capacity for ethical self-organization, for resilience without violence, and for dignity without domination.

It is a dharma of refusal—but also of affirmation: of land, of truth, of community, and of life lived simply, but not passively.

**“The TriDharma of Sumarah”**





## The TriDharma of Sumarah

**[On Screen: Section Title – “The TriDharma of Sumarah”]**

**[Cut to speaker seated in a quiet Javanese-style room, soft natural light filtering through wooden shutters. A small offering sits on a woven mat nearby.]**

In the heart of Java, amid the layered histories of empire, colonization, and spiritual syncretism, a contemplative dharma emerged—not in temples or scriptures, but in silence, surrender, and subtle attunement.

This is the dharma of Sumarah.

Sumarah is not a religion. It is not a doctrine. It is a living path of ethical presence and inner receptivity—an indigenous Javanese contemplative tradition that arose in the 20th century as a response to the dislocations of modernity, colonial trauma, and spiritual fragmentation.

At the heart of Sumarah lies the _TriDharma_—a threefold framework that guides practitioners in cultivating a life of clarity, compassion, and coherence. These are not commandments. They are principles of alignment—between thought, feeling, and action.

**[On Screen: Text fades in, one line at a time]**

- Suwung: Right Thinking  
- Manembah: Right Feeling  
- Tampa Pindha: Right Action

---

### Suwung – Right Thinking

**[B-roll: Footage of a practitioner seated in meditation, eyes closed, breath soft, surrounded by the sounds of wind and birdsong]**

Suwung is often translated as “emptiness,” but it is not a void. It is a spaciousness of mind—a release from grasping, judgment, and conceptual rigidity. It is the cultivation of mental stillness, not through force, but through surrender.

In Suwung, one does not strive to control the mind. One allows it to settle. Thoughts arise and pass like clouds. Awareness remains—open, receptive, unentangled.

This is not escapism. It is clarity. A dharma of cognition that softens reactivity and creates space for discernment.

Modern neuroscience affirms this principle. Studies show that meditative states associated with reduced activity in the brain’s default mode network correlate with increased emotional regulation and attentional stability.

Suwung is not about thinking less. It is about thinking with less friction—with less ego, less fear, less compulsion.

---

### Manembah – Right Feeling

**[B-roll: Footage of a practitioner bowing gently, hands open, a soft smile on their face. Scenes of communal meals, shared laughter, and quiet tears.]**

Manembah is often translated as “devotion” or “reverence,” but in Sumarah, it refers to a quality of feeling—humility, gratitude, and empathic resonance. It is the cultivation of _rasa_—the felt sense of connection, attunement, and care.

In Manembah, one does not suppress emotion. One listens to it. One allows the heart to soften, to open, to feel with—not just for—others.

This is not sentimentality. It is ethical attunement. A dharma of the heart that fosters compassion, patience, and relational presence.

Psychophysiological research supports this. Practices that cultivate gratitude and empathic awareness increase vagal tone, reduce cortisol, and enhance prosocial behavior.

Manembah is not about worshipping a deity. It is about bowing to life itself—with tenderness, with awe, with responsibility.

---

### Tampa Pindha – Right Action

**[B-roll: Footage of a practitioner helping an elder, planting rice, sweeping a courtyard. Movements are slow, deliberate, grounded.]**

Tampa Pindha is the dharma of action. But not action driven by impulse or ideology. It is action that arises from the clarity of Suwung and the compassion of Manembah.

It is decisive, but not rigid. It is responsive, but not reactive. It is the art of doing what is needed—no more, no less—with integrity and care.

In Tampa Pindha, ethics is not a checklist. It is a choreography—of timing, tone, and touch. It is the embodied wisdom of knowing when to speak, when to wait, when to act, and when to yield.

This principle aligns with virtue ethics and practical wisdom. It reflects the Aristotelian ideal of _phronesis_—the capacity to act rightly in complex, changing situations.

Tampa Pindha is not about performance. It is about presence. It is the dharma of the hands, guided by the heart and clarified by the mind.

---

**[Cut to speaker]**

Together, the TriDharma of Sumarah forms a coherent path—not toward transcendence, but toward immanence. Not toward escape, but toward deeper participation in the world.

It is a dharma that resists the fragmentation of modern life—not by retreating into ideology, but by cultivating inner coherence.

It is a dharma that does not seek to dominate, convert, or control. It seeks only to align—to bring thought, feeling, and action into harmony with the rhythms of life.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

&gt; Suwung – The mind, spacious and clear  
&gt; Manembah – The heart, open and attuned  
&gt; Tampa Pindha – The body, responsive and grounded

**[B-roll: Footage of a Sumarah gathering—elders and youth sitting in silence, sharing food, offering blessings]**

In a world of noise, Sumarah offers silence.

In a world of speed, it offers stillness.

In a world of fragmentation, it offers integration.

The TriDharma of Sumarah is not a relic of Javanese mysticism. It is a living dharma—a path of ethical presence that speaks to the deepest needs of our time.

It reminds us that wisdom is not loud. That clarity is not control. That action, when rooted in stillness and compassion, can heal what force cannot.

**“The Māori Code of Tikanga Māori”**





## The Māori Code of Tikanga Māori

**[On Screen: Section Title – “The Māori Code of Tikanga Māori”]**

**[Cut to speaker standing on a windswept coastline in Aotearoa (New Zealand), with waves crashing behind them. The camera slowly pans over carved wooden pou (ancestral posts) and a nearby marae (communal meeting house).]**

_Tikanga Māori_ is not a lawbook. It is not a doctrine. It is a living dharma—an evolving ethical framework that sustains the cultural, social, and spiritual life of the Māori people of Aotearoa.

Derived from the root word *tika*, meaning “right,” “just,” or “appropriate,” _tikanga_ refers to the correct way of doing things. But correctness here is not abstract or universal. It is relational, contextual, and grounded in the web of connections that define Māori life.

**[B-roll: Footage of Māori elders (kaumātua) speaking to youth, communal meals on the marae, and traditional carving and weaving practices.]**

_Tikanga Māori_ is not a set of fixed rules. It is a dynamic system of values, practices, and responsibilities that align people with their ancestors, their land, and their community. It is a dharma of interbeing—of living rightly in a world where everything is connected.

### Foundations of Tikanga

At the heart of _tikanga_ is *whakapapa*—genealogy. But this is not merely a list of ancestors. It is a cosmological map that links people to the land (*whenua*), to the gods (*atua*), and to each other. It affirms that identity is not individual, but relational. One exists not in isolation, but as a node in a vast ancestral network.

From this foundation arise key ethical principles:

- **Mana**: Authority, dignity, and spiritual potency—earned through ethical conduct and service to others.
- **Tapu and Noa**: The sacred and the ordinary—concepts that regulate behavior, protect life, and maintain balance between spiritual and material realms.
- **Mauri**: The life force present in all beings and things—requiring care, respect, and restoration when harmed.
- **Utu**: Reciprocity and balance—ensuring that relationships are maintained through mutual exchange and restoration.

**[On Screen: Text fades in, one line at a time]**

> Mana – Dignity through ethical presence  
> Tapu / Noa – Sacred balance and release  
> Mauri – The vitality of all life  
> Utu – Reciprocity and restoration

**[Cut to speaker]**

These principles are not theoretical. They are enacted through daily life, ritual, and community practice. They shape how one greets a guest, how one harvests a tree, how one mourns the dead, and how one resolves conflict.

_Tikanga Māori_ is not enforced by courts, though it is increasingly recognized in New Zealand law. It is enforced by conscience, by community, and by the invisible presence of ancestors.

**[B-roll: Footage of pōwhiri (welcoming ceremony), haka (ceremonial dance), and rāhui (temporary bans on harvesting to allow ecological regeneration).]**

### Contemporary Expressions

In modern Aotearoa, _tikanga_ continues to evolve. It informs governance, education, environmental stewardship, and social services. It is present in restorative justice programs, in co-governance of natural resources, and in the revitalization of te reo Māori (the Māori language).

Urban Māori communities adapt _tikanga_ to new contexts—blending ancestral wisdom with contemporary realities. Legal systems increasingly recognize the moral force of _tikanga_, particularly in matters of land, water, and cultural heritage.

**[On Screen: Text appears]**

> Tikanga is not tradition preserved in amber.  
> It is tradition in motion—responsive, resilient, alive.

**[Cut to speaker]**

_Tikanga Māori_ is a dharma of place. It cannot be abstracted from the land, from the ancestors, or from the community. It is a way of living that affirms that to be human is to be in relationship—with others, with the earth, and with the unseen.

It is not about individual rights. It is about collective responsibilities.

It is not about domination of nature. It is about guardianship—*kaitiakitanga*—the sacred duty to protect and sustain the living world.

**[B-roll: Footage of Māori youth planting native trees, elders teaching traditional navigation, and community-led environmental initiatives.]**

### Connections to Other Dharmic Traditions

_Tikanga Māori_ shares deep affinities with other dharmic frameworks around the world.

- Like **Ubuntu** in Southern Africa, it affirms that personhood is relational.
- Like **Confucianism**, it emphasizes ritual, respect, and the moral cultivation of social roles.
- Like **Daoism**, it seeks harmony with the natural world through non-coercive action.
- Like **Buddhism**, it recognizes impermanence and the need for ethical mindfulness in every moment.

From a systems theory perspective, _tikanga_ functions as a feedback system—regulating social and ecological balance through ritual, reciprocity, and embodied ethics.

From an evolutionary perspective, it encodes pro-social behaviors—fairness, empathy, and cooperation—that enhance group cohesion and resilience.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

> Tikanga is not law.  
> It is life held in right relationship.

**[Cut to speaker]**

In a world increasingly shaped by fragmentation, ecological crisis, and cultural amnesia, _tikanga Māori_ offers a path of coherence. It reminds us that ethics is not an abstraction. It is a practice. A presence. A way of walking in the world with care.

It is a dharma that teaches not through commandments, but through connection.

Not through conquest, but through continuity.

Not through control, but through care.

**“Inclusive Dharmas, Exclusive Dharmas”**





## Inclusive Dharmas, Exclusive Dharmas

**[On Screen: Section Title – “Inclusive Dharmas, Exclusive Dharmas”]**

**[Cut to speaker standing in front of a split-screen display: on one side, images of interfaith gatherings, humanitarian aid, and global cooperation; on the other, footage of monastic enclaves, warrior codes, and tribal rituals.]**

Dharmas are not all alike in their scope or orientation. Some are expansive, reaching outward across cultural, ethnic, and religious boundaries. Others are bounded, inward-facing, designed to preserve the integrity of a specific community, lineage, or vocation.

These two orientations—what we might call inclusive and exclusive dharmas—are not opposites. They are complementary strategies for sustaining ethical life in a complex and impermanent world.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

> Inclusive dharmas expand the moral circle.  
> Exclusive dharmas deepen the moral core.

---

### Inclusive Dharmas

Inclusive dharmas arise in contexts where cooperation across group boundaries becomes essential—urbanization, trade, pluralism, ecological interdependence, and global crisis. They emphasize universal values such as compassion, justice, dignity, and mutual care.

**[B-roll: Footage of interfaith prayer, disaster relief teams, climate marches, and multicultural classrooms.]**

Mahayana Buddhism, with its Bodhisattva ideal, exemplifies this orientation. The Bodhisattva vows not to enter final liberation until all sentient beings are free from suffering. Compassion here is not tribal. It is cosmic.

Ubuntu, the African dharma of relational personhood, affirms that “I am because we are.” It does not ask who belongs to the tribe, but how we belong to each other. It is a dharma of mutual recognition, where dignity is affirmed through connection.

Secular humanism, too, functions as an inclusive dharma. It grounds ethics not in revelation, but in shared humanity. It calls for universal rights, global solidarity, and the cultivation of empathy beyond borders.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

> Inclusive dharmas are bridges.  
> They connect across difference.  
> They respond to scale with solidarity.

---

### Exclusive Dharmas

Exclusive dharmas emerge in contexts where identity, continuity, and boundary maintenance are paramount. They define roles, obligations, and rituals that sustain the coherence of a particular group—be it a monastic order, a warrior caste, or an indigenous community.

**[B-roll: Footage of Jain monks walking barefoot, Amish communities at work, samurai training in traditional dojos.]**

Bushidō, the Japanese Way of the Warrior, is a martial dharma rooted in loyalty, honor, and self-discipline. It is not universal. It is specific—to the samurai, to their code, to their historical role. Its compassion is not abstract. It is expressed through duty, restraint, and sacrifice within a defined sphere.

The dharma of the Samin of Java is similarly exclusive—not in hostility, but in self-containment. It does not seek to convert or expand. It seeks to preserve a way of life grounded in honesty, simplicity, and refusal of external domination.

Monastic dharmas—whether Buddhist, Christian, or Hindu—often require vows of celibacy, renunciation, and obedience. These are not for everyone. They are paths of intensity, not inclusivity. Their compassion is cultivated inwardly, through discipline and detachment.

### The Locus of Compassion

Where, then, is compassion located in these divergent dharmas?

In inclusive dharmas, compassion is expansive. It flows outward, embracing the stranger, the outsider, the other. It is the compassion of the Bodhisattva, the humanitarian, the reconciler.

In exclusive dharmas, compassion is intensive. It is cultivated through form, ritual, and discipline. It is the compassion of the healer who trains for decades, the monk who prays in silence, the warrior who dies to protect their people.

Both are valid. Both are necessary.

**[Cut to speaker]**

Inclusive dharmas teach us to widen our circle of care. Exclusive dharmas teach us to deepen it. One opens the hand. The other steadies the grip.

In a fragmented world, we need both: the openness to embrace difference, and the rootedness to preserve integrity.

**[Cut to speaker]**

The challenge is not to choose one dharma over another, but to discern their function, their limits, and their gifts. Inclusive dharmas can become vague, losing depth. Exclusive dharmas can become rigid, losing relevance.

The task is to weave them—so that our ethics are both rooted and responsive, both particular and planetary.

**“Dharmas as Aesthetic, Dharmas as Identity”**





## Dharmas as Aesthetic, Dharmas as Identity

**[On Screen: Section Title – “Dharmas as Aesthetic, Dharmas as Identity”]**

**[Cut to speaker standing in front of a museum exhibit of traditional garments, ritual objects, and cultural symbols from around the world]**

Dharmas are not only ethical frameworks or systems of thought. They are also embodied. They are worn, performed, and displayed. They shape not only how we act, but how we appear—how we signal who we are, what we value, and where we belong.

A dharma is not merely internal. It is aesthetic. It is identity.

**[B-roll: Footage of a Theravāda monk adjusting his saffron robe, a Hare Krishna devotee dancing in traditional attire, an Amish family walking in plain dress, a Sufi dervish spinning in white garments]**

The aesthetic dimension of a dharma is not superficial. It is not decoration. It is the visible expression of an ethical commitment. It is a form of embodied signaling—communicating alignment, discipline, and belonging.

In evolutionary terms, aesthetic markers serve as group identifiers. They reduce ambiguity, enhance trust, and reinforce cohesion. In small-scale societies, dress, ornamentation, and ritual gesture distinguish insiders from outsiders. In large-scale societies, these markers become more complex—layered with history, status, and ideology.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

> A dharma is not only believed.  
> It is worn.  
> It is walked.  
> It is seen.

**[Cut to speaker]**

Consider the saffron robes of Buddhist monks. They are not merely functional garments. They symbolize renunciation, humility, and continuity with a lineage that stretches back to the Buddha himself. To wear the robe is to enter a dharma—not just intellectually, but bodily.

Or the plain dress of the Amish. It is not a rejection of beauty, but an affirmation of simplicity, humility, and separation from the values of modern consumer culture. It is a sartorial dharma—a daily discipline that reinforces communal identity and ethical restraint.

**[B-roll: Footage of Amish communities, Buddhist monasteries, and Hare Krishna processions in Western cities]**

In contemporary contexts, dharmas often migrate across cultures—and with them, their aesthetics. Western converts to Buddhism may adopt robes, malas, and shaven heads. Indonesian Muslims may adopt Arabized dress to signal piety and alignment with a global ummah. Hare Krishna devotees wear dhotis and saris, chant Sanskrit mantras, and follow a dharma that fuses Indian devotionalism with Western countercultural longing.

These aesthetic choices are not trivial. They are technologies of identity. They mark a transition from one mode of life to another. They signal commitment, transformation, and belonging.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

> To change one’s clothing  
> is often to change one’s world.

**[Cut to speaker]**

But aesthetics are not only about clothing. They include architecture, music, gesture, and digital presence. A dharma may be expressed through the design of a temple, the rhythm of a chant, the layout of a website, or the tone of a social media post.

In digital spaces, dharmas manifest through avatars, hashtags, and curated aesthetics. A minimalist Instagram account may signal a dharma of simplicity. A climate activist’s profile may reflect a dharma of ecological responsibility. A gamer’s avatar may embody a dharma of honor, loyalty, or rebellion.

These are not mere styles. They are signals of ethical orientation—of who we are, what we stand for, and how we wish to be seen.

**[B-roll: Footage of TikTok rituals, eco-conscious fashion, protest art, and digital avatars in virtual worlds]**

Aesthetics also serve as boundary markers. They distinguish one dharma from another. They create in-group cohesion, but also out-group differentiation. This can foster solidarity—but also exclusion, appropriation, and conflict.

When dharmic aesthetics are adopted without understanding, they can become hollow—symbols without substance. When they are commodified, they risk becoming fashion rather than function.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

> A dharma worn without understanding  
> is costume.  
> A dharma lived through form  
> is coherence.

**[Cut to speaker]**

The challenge, then, is not to reject aesthetic expression, but to deepen it. To ask: What does this garment, this ritual, this symbol mean? What dharma does it embody? What commitment does it express?

Aesthetics are not optional. They are integral. They are how dharmas become visible, memorable, and transmissible. They are how dharmas enter the body, the street, the screen.

They are how dharmas become identity—not as ego, but as orientation.

## Secular Dharmas? The Journey to the West

**[On Screen: Section Title – “Secular Dharmas? The Journey to the West”]**

**[Cut to speaker standing in a modern urban setting—glass buildings, bicycles, people on laptops in cafés. The hum of contemporary life in the background.]**

Dharmas are not bound to temples, robes, or rituals. They are not the property of any single tradition, language, or geography. They are frameworks—adaptive, evolving, and emergent—that arise wherever human beings seek to live with coherence, care, and clarity.

In the West, the word “dharma” arrived late. It came as a whisper through translations of Sanskrit texts, as a chant in the mouths of monks, as a symbol of exotic wisdom. But the function of dharma—the need it answers—has always been present.

The West, too, has generated dharmas. They have not always been called by that name, but they have served the same purpose: to orient life ethically, socially, and existentially.

**[B-roll: Footage of Greek philosophers in statues, Roman legal codes, Enlightenment salons, and modern protest marches.]**

The Stoic path of virtue, the Hippocratic oath of the healer, the Benedictine rule of monastic life, the civic dharma of democratic citizenship—these are dharmas in function, if not in name. They are structured responses to the question: *How shall we live, together, in a world of suffering and change?*

But in the modern West, many of these traditional dharmas have eroded. The collapse of religious authority, the fragmentation of community, the acceleration of technology, and the rise of individualism have left many disoriented—free, but unmoored.

In this vacuum, new dharmas have begun to emerge—secular, experimental, and often implicit. They are not codified in sacred texts. They are not guarded by priests. But they function as dharmas nonetheless.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

### The Forms of Secular Dharmas

**[Cut to speaker in a co-working space, surrounded by books on psychology, systems theory, and ethics.]**

Secular dharmas arise in diverse domains:

- **Mindfulness-Based Practices**: Rooted in Buddhist meditation, but stripped of religious framing, these practices offer a dharma of attention, presence, and emotional regulation. They are taught in hospitals, schools, and corporate boardrooms—not as salvation, but as sanity.

- **Environmental Ethics**: In the face of ecological collapse, a dharma of planetary stewardship has emerged. It calls for restraint, reverence, and responsibility—not because the Earth is sacred, but because it is interdependent with our survival.

- **Tech Ethics**: As artificial intelligence, surveillance, and digital life reshape human experience, new dharmas are being crafted—centered on transparency, fairness, and harm reduction. These are not commandments from God. They are protocols for coexistence.

- **Social Justice Movements**: Activist communities often function as dharmic ecosystems—complete with initiation, moral codes, rituals of protest, and shared narratives of suffering and redemption. They offer belonging, purpose, and ethical clarity in a fractured world.

**[B-roll: Footage of mindfulness workshops, climate protests, AI ethics panels, and community organizing meetings.]**

These secular dharmas are not unified. They are plural, provisional, and often contested. But they share key characteristics:

- They are grounded in lived experience, not revelation.
- They are informed by science, but not reducible to it.
- They are oriented toward care, justice, and sustainability.
- They are adaptive, open to revision, and responsive to feedback.

### The Future of Dharmas in the West

**[Cut to speaker walking through a public park—children playing, people meditating, others reading or talking quietly.]**

As the West continues to grapple with crises of meaning, identity, and belonging, the need for dharmas will not disappear. It will intensify.

The question is not whether dharmas will exist, but what form they will take.

Will they be rooted in ancient wisdom, or forged anew?

Will they be exclusive, preserving subcultural integrity, or inclusive, bridging global divides?

Will they be aesthetic, signaling identity through form, or contemplative, cultivating inner clarity?

Will they be digital, algorithmic, and decentralized—or embodied, local, and slow?

**[B-roll: Footage of virtual reality meditation apps, slow-living communities, digital nomads, and intergenerational dialogue circles.]**

The dharmas of the future may not resemble those of the past. They may emerge in unexpected places—in design studios, in open-source communities, in climate resilience networks, in trauma-informed schools.

But their function will remain the same: to hold life together.

To orient the self within complexity.

To align action with care.

To sustain coherence in a world of impermanence.

**[On Screen: Text fades in]**

**[Cut to speaker, seated in a quiet room, surrounded by books, artifacts, and a small candle burning.]**

This journey has taken us across continents and centuries—from the forests of India to the courts of China, from the rice fields of Java to the digital cities of the West.

We have seen that dharmas are not relics. They are responses.

They are not fixed. They are evolving.

They are not imposed. They are inhabited.

And in every age, they arise from the same human need: to live well, together, in a world that is always changing.
